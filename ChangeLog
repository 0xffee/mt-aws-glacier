2013-02-23: v0.87 beta
	* More verbose error message if we found broken UTF-8 in filenames
	* More verbose error message in case of permission problems when reading files from disk 
	* Error checking for key/secret/region format added
	* Some minor internal changes and test improvements
	
2013-01-29: v0.86 beta
	* Bug fixed: when doing retrieval or delete, crash after successful finishing (only happened when concurrency=1). Regression of bug fixed 0.76beta.
	* Changed project file structure. Modules moved to lib/App/MtAws
	* mtglacier.pl now deprected, use mtglacier
	* Now you can execute mtglacier command from any directory, or create a symlink to it - it will find other package files by itself 
	* Minor fixes in help command output and cosmetic changes

2013-01-28: v0.85 beta
	* Create/delete vault support

2013-01-28: v0.84 beta
	* HTTPS Support added
	* Bug fixed: Some (UTF-8) metadata characters was double-encoded (however it can be read without problems)
	* Compatibility - Amazon Glacier Metadata: only backward compatible with previous versions. 
	* Documentation improvements
	* Error checking improved when reading config file

2013-01-21: v0.83 beta
	* Bug fixed. File modification time 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z0 (i.e. epoch time = 0 ) was causing crash when uploading and missing file report when check-local-hash
	* Main script: Changed shebang from /usr/bin/perl to /usr/bin/env - this will allow Mac Port users to work out of the box
	* Main script: Cosmetic changes in --help output
	* Documentation: added names of CentOS packages, better example of config file, cosmetic changes, fixed spelling mistakes    

2013-01-12: v0.82 beta
	* retrieve-inventory/download-inventory commands added. You can now restore journal file from scratch, from Amazon Glacier metadata
	* Now when downloading files from glacier - restore original modification time
	* Fixed - File modification time - date before 1970 were not working
	* Improvement in error checking command line parameters
	* Error checking added for read/write availability of journal file
	* Internal: improvements to unit tests
	
2013-01-02: v0.81 beta
	* Error handling when parsing command line implemented + --help command
	* Security - considering filenames coming from "external" sources (from Glacier and from Journal file) as unsecure. Sanitize/check it.
	* Some internal changes to TreeHash implementing (does not affect working code, but needs for future enhancements)
	* Dependency removed - MIME::Base64::encode_base64url (implemented in 2010 in MIME::Base64), This function is re-implemented. So we can use older versions of this module.
	
2012-12-27: v0.80 beta
	* Storing Amazon Glacier metadata (x-amz-archive-description) when upload files implemented (using custom format).
	* More verbose output for check-local-hash command
	* Internal: Huge testsuite improvements
	* Internal: Refactored: command-line options processing, Glacier requests code, main program, misc 
	* New Journal format: added support of file modification time, added journal version makers (software fully works with old journal files)

2012-12-07: v0.78 beta
	* Full internal UTF-8 support introduced. Can use wide characters in filenames, command line options
	
2012-12-05: v0.77 beta
	* Replace File::Path::make_path with legacy method File::Path::mkpath so it's compatible now with older perl distribution (File::Path 1.08 CentOS 5.8)
	* fixed problem when relative filenames start with "0" character
	
2012-11-21: v0.76 beta
	* Retrieval work improved: Can use more than just 50 first retrieval jobs (walking job list pagination). Requesting only
	completed job list,	so use fewer requests.
	* Fixed bug when restore process crashed after successful finishing (only happened when concurrency=1)
	* Documentation fixes: Installation instructions improved. Help/Contribute section added.
	 
2012-11-17: v0.75 beta
	* Bug fixed when signature not calculated right with retrieve requests (bug found in 0.74 after SHA256 optimization)
	* Increased internal limit for maximum in-progress files while uploading (was 3 now 30)
			
2012-11-15: v0.74 beta
	* Improved CPU usage apprx 30% - 1) SHA256 was calculated twice sometimes 2) In case data chunk < 1 MB we can use that TreeHash is equal to SHA256
	* Debug code removed, which were causing failing requests in 20% cases
	* Some refactoring
			
2012-11-15: v0.73 beta
	* Sign request right before sending to network. Fixing the following 1) when request is retried due to 408/500 error,
	we resign it, thus timestamp won't expire 2) put all heavy operations like SHA calculation before signature/timestamp
	calculation
	* Some legacy code removed
	
2012-10-24: v0.72 beta
	* Some effort to manage mtglacier version information, print version each run. Report version in HTTP UserAgent string. 
	* Show some progress when reading large local directory listings
	* Retry with throttling 408/500 HTTP requests. 408 can mean timeout/bad bandwidth. 500 means Amazon not ready yet.
	* Some old unused code removed
	* Option --max-number-of-files now works with "sync" and limits number of files to synchronize
	* More verbose output
	* For certain commands like Sync read only not-yet-synced filenames into memory (saves memory when working with huge filesets)
	* Use Journal module to handle journals and file listings + unit test the module

2012-08-28: v0.7 beta
	initial release
