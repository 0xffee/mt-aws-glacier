current snapshot
	* Storing Amazon Glacier metadata (x-amz-archive-description) when upload files implemented (using custom format).
	* More verbose output for check-local-hash command
	* Internal: Huge testsuite improvements
	* Internal: Refactored: command-line options processing, Glacier requests code, main program 
	* New Journal format: added support of file modification time, added journal version makers (software fully works with old journal files)

2012-12-07: v0.78 beta
	* Full internal UTF-8 support introduced. Can use wide characters in filenames, command line options
	
2012-12-05: v0.77 beta
	* Replace File::Path::make_path with legacy method File::Path::mkpath so it's compatible now with older perl distribution (File::Path 1.08 CentOS 5.8)
	* fixed problem when relative filenames start with "0" character
	
2012-11-21: v0.76 beta
	* Retrieval work improved: Can use more than just 50 first retrieval jobs (walking job list pagination). Requesting only
	completed job list,	so use fewer requests.
	* Fixed bug when restore process crashed after successful finishing (only happened when concurrency=1)
	* Documentation fixes: Installation instructions improved. Help/Contribute section added.
	 
2012-11-17: v0.75 beta
	* Bug fixed when signature not calculated right with retrieve requests (bug found in 0.74 after SHA256 optimization)
	* Increased internal limit for maximum in-progress files while uploading (was 3 now 30)
			
2012-11-15: v0.74 beta
	* Improved CPU usage apprx 30% - 1) SHA256 was calculated twice sometimes 2) In case data chunk < 1 MB we can use that TreeHash is equal to SHA256
	* Debug code removed, which were causing failing requests in 20% cases
	* Some refactoring
			
2012-11-15: v0.73 beta
	* Sign request right before sending to network. Fixing the following 1) when request is retried due to 408/500 error,
	we resign it, thus timestamp won't expire 2) put all heavy operations like SHA calculation before signature/timestamp
	calculation
	* Some legacy code removed
	
2012-10-24: v0.72 beta
	* Some effort to manage mtglacier version information, print version each run. Report version in HTTP UserAgent string. 
	* Show some progress when reading large local directory listings
	* Retry with throttling 408/500 HTTP requests. 408 can mean timeout/bad bandwidth. 500 means Amazon not ready yet.
	* Some old unused code removed
	* Option --max-number-of-files now works with "sync" and limits number of files to synchronize
	* More verbose output
	* For certain commands like Sync read only not-yet-synced filenames into memory (saves memory when working with huge filesets)
	* Use Journal module to handle journals and file listings + unit test the module

2012-08-28: v0.7 beta
