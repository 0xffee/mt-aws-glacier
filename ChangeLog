			* Sign request right before sending to network. Fixing the following 1) when request is retried due to 408/500 error,
			we resign it, thus timestamp won't expire 2) put all heavy operations like SHA calculation before signature/timestamp
			calculation
			* Some legacy code removed
2012-10-24: v0.72 beta
			* Some effort to manage mtglacier version information, print version each run. Report version in HTTP UserAgent string. 
			* Show some progress when reading large local directory listings
			* Retry with throttling 408/500 HTTP requests. 408 can mean timeout/bad bandwidth. 500 means Amazon not ready yet.
			* Some old unused code removed
			* Option --max-number-of-files now works with "sync" and limits number of files to synchronize
			* More verbose output
			* For certain commands like Sync read only not-yet-synced filenames into memory (saves memory when working with huge filesets)
			* Use Journal module to handle journals and file listings + unit test the module
