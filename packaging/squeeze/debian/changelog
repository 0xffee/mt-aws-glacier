libapp-mtaws-perl (1.101-0vdebian1~v6~mt1) squeeze; urgency=low

  * Fixed: CPAN install was failing for non-English locales due to brittle test related to new FSM introduced in 1.100
  Also error message when reading from file failed in the middle of transfer was wrong for non-English locales.

  * Added validation - max allowed by Amazon --partsize is 4096 Mb

  * Fixed: --check-max-file-size option validation upper limit was wrong. Was: 40 000 000 Mb; Fixed: 4 096 0000 Mb

libapp-mtaws-perl (1.100-0vdebian1~v6~mt1) squeeze; urgency=low

  * Nothing new for end users (I hope so ). Huge internal refactoring of FSM (task queue engine) + unit
  tests for all new FSM + integration testing for all mtglacier commands.

libapp-mtaws-perl (1.059-0vdebian1~v6~mt1) squeeze; urgency=low

  * Fixed: Dry-run with restore completed was crashing.
  Fixed a bug introduced in v0.971
  dry-run and restore-completed used archive_id instead of relative filename and thus was crashing with message:
  UNEXPECTED ERROR: SOMEARCHIVEID not found in journal at ... /lib/App/MtAws/Journal.pm line 247.

libapp-mtaws-perl (1.058-0vdebian1~v6~mt1) squeeze; urgency=low

  * Fixed - when downloading inventory there could be Perl warning message ("use initialized ..") in case when some
  specific metadata (x-amz-archive-description) strings (like empty strings) met. Such metadata can appear if
  archives were uploaded by 3rd party apps.

  * Fixed possible deadlock before process termination (after success run or after Ctrl-C), related to issue
  https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=93428 - select() is not always interruptable. Issue seen
  under heavy load, under perl 5.14, with concurrency=1 (unlikely affects concurrency modes > 1 )

  * Fixed - when deprecated option for command (say, --vault for check-local-hash) was found in config, there was a
  warning that option deprecated, however that should not happen, because everything that is in config should be
  read only when such option required (you should be able to put any unneeded option into config)
