libapp-mtaws-perl (1.112-0ubuntu1~trusty1~ppa1) trusty; urgency=low

  * PPA package for Ubuntu 14.04 added to Ubuntu PPA (+ fixes in metadata of Debian/Ubuntu packages)

  * Workaround: 31 December 2013 Amazon introduced extension to inventory retrieval API: now one can request for just
  a part of inventory. This, however, can break mt-aws-glacier behaviour in rare circumstances i.e. when you use 3rd
  party app to request a part of inventory and then run mt-aws-glacier to get full inventory, mt-aws-glacier can
  download partial inventory instead of full. (details here https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=143107).

  Releasing workaround now - mt-aws-glacier now tried to check if this is a full inventory (it's still possible for the
  bug to appear very-very rare circumstances i.e. if 3rd party app will request for part inventory with limit set and
  then request for continuation without any limits).

  Also, now all inventory jobs raised by mt-aws-glacier have special marker. In the future versions bug will be fully
  fixed as all non-mtglacier jobs will be disabled.

  * Fixed several brittle tests introduced in v1.110, preventing mtglacier from install via CPAN on some systems:
  - systems with perl 5.18.1, 5.18.2 and stock version of Digest::SHA
  - old systems (i suspect RHEL5 without any CPAN modules installed) with old version of File::Temp
  - Cygwin

  * Documentation: Warning about incompatibility of metadata added to Must Read section

  * Documentation: Fixed - installation instructions for Debian via custom repository improved - lsb_release command,
  used in install instruction, was not a part of (some?) minimal Debian installs. So some users experienced problems
  installing mtglacier first time. I suspect users who use FISH shell were affected too.
