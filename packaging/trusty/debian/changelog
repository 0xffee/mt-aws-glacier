libapp-mtaws-perl (1.116-0ubuntu1~trusty1~ppa1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Fixed - there can be issue on MacOSX that HTTPS is not working: All requests end up with errors "HTTP connection
  problem (timeout?)". Found that Apple ships LWP::Protocol::https without Mozilla::CA module (and they have no rights to
  do so). So now a README install instructions updated and runtime error thrown if Mozilla::CA is missing and yo're trying
  to use HTTPS. More technical info: http://blogs.perl.org/users/vsespb/2014/07/broken-lwp-in-the-wild.html

  * Fixed - typo in error message.

libapp-mtaws-perl (1.115-0ubuntu1~trusty1~ppa1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Fixed - crash/error when uploading large files with partsize=1024, when "old" Digest::SHA (< 5.63; shipped with most
  of current linux distros) is installed. Old Digest::SHA has a bug, there was a workaround for it (i.e. message asking
  to upgrade module) when it's used with large files on 32bit machines, but apparently seems 64bit machines
  also affected.
  Now a message removed, instead workaround code written so it now works with old buggy versions fine (i.e. splits large
  chunks into smalled ones when feeding Digest::SHA).

  * Since v1.113 Ubuntu Raring 13.04 PPA is discontinued (due to End of Life of Ubuntu Raring, launchpad PPA stopped
  building binaries for it)

libapp-mtaws-perl (1.114-0ubuntu1~trusty1~ppa1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Fixed: a crash with message:
  UNEXPECTED ERROR: archive XXXXXX...XXX not found in archive_h

  mtglacier was crashing if --filter/--include/--exclude options applied, and a file, previously deleted in
  Journal (i.e. with --purge-vault or --delete-removed) excluded by this filter.

  i.e. when file deleted, a record about deletion is appended to Journal (and previously there was a record
  about creation). when journal is read, creation record is skipped (because filters applied), but deletion record was
  not checked by filter. thus mtglacier detected it problem with journal consistency (attempt to delete unexistant file)

libapp-mtaws-perl (1.113-0ubuntu1~trusty1~ppa1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Fixed: Y2038 problem with file modification time in metadata (i.e. journal and Amazon Glacier servers).
  Some OSes and filesystems don't support years after 2038 (i.e. Linux 32bit)
  Some perl versions don't support handling dates after 2038 (i.e. 32bit perl before 5.12 and
  64bit perl 5.8.8 (RHEL5), 5.10.0 (some SUSE))

  There is not much sense in having files with file modification after Y2038 or before Y1902, however such file can
  appear in filesystems due to bugs in other software etc.

  Fixing now inconsistency in behaviour with such metadata between different OS/perl versions.

  After this fix file modification time will be restored correctly from Amazon servers to journal (via download-inventory)
  on all platforms, for all years in range 1000-9999.

  However if your OS/filesystem does not work with such dates, anything except correct date in journal file
  is not guaranteed.

  Before this fix, such dates could result in lost of filenames and modification time in journal (filename replaced
  with random token) when restoring inventory (you are affected if you uploaded file on 64bit system with date
  after Y2038, but then restored on 32bit system).

  * Documentation: Also, note about Y2038 added to "Limitationss" section.

  * CSV inventory parsing - making it 30% slower, but more consistent with what Amazon documented about its format
  https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=141807&tstart=0

  * Cosmetic changes to docs

  * CPAN install - on some systems like ARM, some NAS, 32bit OSes decrease number of concurrent tests during install.
  Might help preventing out-of-memory problems (but makes test slower).

libapp-mtaws-perl (1.112-0ubuntu1~trusty1~ppa1) trusty; urgency=low

  * PPA package for Ubuntu 14.04 added to Ubuntu PPA (+ fixes in metadata of Debian/Ubuntu packages)

  * Workaround: 31 December 2013 Amazon introduced extension to inventory retrieval API: now one can request for just
  a part of inventory. This, however, can break mt-aws-glacier behaviour in rare circumstances i.e. when you use 3rd
  party app to request a part of inventory and then run mt-aws-glacier to get full inventory, mt-aws-glacier can
  download partial inventory instead of full. (details here https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=143107).

  Releasing workaround now - mt-aws-glacier now tried to check if this is a full inventory (it's still possible for the
  bug to appear very-very rare circumstances i.e. if 3rd party app will request for part inventory with limit set and
  then request for continuation without any limits).

  Also, now all inventory jobs raised by mt-aws-glacier have special marker. In the future versions bug will be fully
  fixed as all non-mtglacier jobs will be disabled.

  * Fixed several brittle tests introduced in v1.110, preventing mtglacier from install via CPAN on some systems:
  - systems with perl 5.18.1, 5.18.2 and stock version of Digest::SHA
  - old systems (i suspect RHEL5 without any CPAN modules installed) with old version of File::Temp
  - Cygwin

  * Documentation: Warning about incompatibility of metadata added to Must Read section

  * Documentation: Fixed - installation instructions for Debian via custom repository improved - lsb_release command,
  used in install instruction, was not a part of (some?) minimal Debian installs. So some users experienced problems
  installing mtglacier first time. I suspect users who use FISH shell were affected too.
