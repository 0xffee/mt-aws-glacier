libapp-mtaws-perl (1.112-0ubuntu1~quantal1~ppa1) quantal; urgency=low

  * PPA package for Ubuntu 14.04 added to Ubuntu PPA (+ fixes in metadata of Debian/Ubuntu packages)

  * Workaround: 31 December 2013 Amazon introduced extension to inventory retrieval API: now one can request for just
  a part of inventory. This, however, can break mt-aws-glacier behaviour in rare circumstances i.e. when you use 3rd
  party app to request a part of inventory and then run mt-aws-glacier to get full inventory, mt-aws-glacier can
  download partial inventory instead of full. (details here https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=143107).

  Releasing workaround now - mt-aws-glacier now tried to check if this is a full inventory (it's still possible for the
  bug to appear very-very rare circumstances i.e. if 3rd party app will request for part inventory with limit set and
  then request for continuation without any limits).

  Also, now all inventory jobs raised by mt-aws-glacier have special marker. In the future versions bug will be fully
  fixed as all non-mtglacier jobs will be disabled.

  * Fixed several brittle tests introduced in v1.110, preventing mtglacier from install via CPAN on some systems:
  - systems with perl 5.18.1, 5.18.2 and stock version of Digest::SHA
  - old systems (i suspect RHEL5 without any CPAN modules installed) with old version of File::Temp
  - Cygwin

  * Documentation: Warning about incompatibility of metadata added to Must Read section

  * Documentation: Fixed - installation instructions for Debian via custom repository improved - lsb_release command,
  used in install instruction, was not a part of (some?) minimal Debian installs. So some users experienced problems
  installing mtglacier first time. I suspect users who use FISH shell were affected too.

libapp-mtaws-perl (1.110-0ubuntu1~quantal1~ppa1) quantal; urgency=low

  * Compatibility: upload-file with --filename option behaviour slightly changed:
  both --filename and --dir now resolved to full paths, before determining relative path from --dir` to --filename`
  So f you have `/dir/ds` symlink to `/dir/d3` directory, then `--dir=/dir` `--filename=/dir/ds/file` will result in
  relative filename `d3/file` not `ds/file`. Previously you would get d3/file. Also now all parent directories has
  to be readable.

  * Documentation: documentation for upload-file updated.

  * Fixed: #63 internaly mtglacier was using absolute filenames when reading/writing file in filesystem, even if user
  specified relative. Seems that was wrong. Undex Unix file can be readable by relative name but unaccessible by real,
  absolute name if path components of this name are unreadable. Fixed now - always use relative filenames in all commands
  except upload-file command (where it's documented that absolute names are used).
  This change does not affect relative filenames stroed in journal or amazon glacier metadata in any way.
  This change might affect filenames format that you see in mtglacier output.

  * Fixed: some bugs related to directory traversal under old-old perl installations (RHEL 5.x, when no new
  CPAN modules installed) worked around.

  * Fixed: upload-file with --filename and --dir were not working correctly for most of perl installations
  if dir started with "..". This due to bug https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=111510 in File::Spec module.
  Currently upload-file behaviour changed (see above in ChangeLog) so  mtglacier not affected. In previous versions this
  would result in wrong relative filenames in journal and Amazon glacier metadata
  (precisely, those filenames are without path prefix, as if they would be in current directory, otherwise filename
  part is correct).

  * Workaround: Digest::SHA perl module prior to version 5.62 calculates SHA256 wrong on 32bit machines, when data
  size is more than 2^29 bytes. Now mtglacier throws an error if --partsize >= 512Mb and machine is 32bit and digest-sha
  version is below 5.62. Commands which don't use --partsize are unaffected.

  * Fixed: Amazon CSV format parsing: Amazon escapes doublequote with backslash but.. does not escape backslash itself.
  https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=141807
  This format is undocumented and broken by design. Fixing parser now to parse this.
  this bug was not affecting any real use of mtglacier as mtglacier does not use backslashes in metadata and ignores
  foreign metadata.

  * Cosmetic changes to process manager code

libapp-mtaws-perl (1.103-0ubuntu1~quantal1~ppa1) quantal; urgency=low

  * Fixed: issue #48 download-inventory was crashing if there was a request for inventory retrieval in CSV format
  issued by 3rd party application. mt-aws-glacier was not supporting CSV and thus crashing.
  It's hard to determine inventory format until you download it, so mt-aws-glacier now supports CSV parsing.

  * Fixed: download-inventory command now fetches latest inventory, not oldest

  * Added --request-inventory-format option for retrieve-inventory commands

  * Documentation: updated docs for retrieve-inventory and retrieve-inventory and download-inventory commands

  * Fixed: memory/reasource leak, introduced in v1.100. Usually resulting in crash after uploading ~ 1000 files ( too
  many open files error)

  * Minor improvements to process termination code

libapp-mtaws-perl (1.101-0ubuntu1~quantal1~ppa1) quantal; urgency=low

  * Fixed: CPAN install was failing for non-English locales due to brittle test related to new FSM introduced in 1.100
  Also error message when reading from file failed in the middle of transfer was wrong for non-English locales.

  * Added validation - max allowed by Amazon --partsize is 4096 Mb

  * Fixed: --check-max-file-size option validation upper limit was wrong. Was: 40 000 000 Mb; Fixed: 4 096 0000 Mb

  * Nothing new for end users (I hope so ). Huge internal refactoring of FSM (task queue engine) + unit
  tests for all new FSM + integration testing for all mtglacier commands.

  * Fixed: Dry-run with restore completed was crashing.
  Fixed a bug introduced in v0.971
  dry-run and restore-completed used archive_id instead of relative filename and thus was crashing with message:
  UNEXPECTED ERROR: SOMEARCHIVEID not found in journal at ... /lib/App/MtAws/Journal.pm line 247.

libapp-mtaws-perl (1.058-0ubuntu1~quantal1~ppa1) quantal; urgency=low

  * Fixed - when downloading inventory there could be Perl warning message ("use initialized ..") in case when some
  specific metadata (x-amz-archive-description) strings (like empty strings) met. Such metadata can appear if
  archives were uploaded by 3rd party apps.

  * Fixed possible deadlock before process termination (after success run or after Ctrl-C), related to issue
  https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=93428 - select() is not always interruptable. Issue seen
  under heavy load, under perl 5.14, with concurrency=1 (unlikely affects concurrency modes > 1 )

  * Fixed - when deprecated option for command (say, --vault for check-local-hash) was found in config, there was a
  warning that option deprecated, however that should not happen, because everything that is in config should be
  read only when such option required (you should be able to put any unneeded option into config)
