libapp-mtaws-perl (1.058-0vdebian1~v8~mt1) jessie; urgency=low

  * Fixed - when downloading inventory there could be Perl warning message ("use initialized ..") in case when some
  specific metadata (x-amz-archive-description) strings (like empty strings) met. Such metadata can appear if
  archives were uploaded by 3rd party apps.

  * Fixed possible deadlock before process termination (after success run or after Ctrl-C), related to issue
  https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=93428 - select() is not always interruptable. Issue seen
  under heavy load, under perl 5.14, with concurrency=1 (unlikely affects concurrency modes > 1 )

  * Fixed - when deprecated option for command (say, --vault for check-local-hash) was found in config, there was a
  warning that option deprecated, however that should not happen, because everything that is in config should be
  read only when such option required (you should be able to put any unneeded option into config)
